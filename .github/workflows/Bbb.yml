# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # /*Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:


class Solution {

        int val=0;
        for(int i=0;i<=len;++i)
           val=val^i;
        
        int xorval=0;
        for(int i=0;i<len;++i)
            xorval=xorval^nums[i];
        
        int res;
        res=val^xorval;
       return res;   
       exit
    }
}Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "c57cb62b-d944-4d7e-87ed-9a1ecef42b90" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "c57cb62b-d944-4d7e-87ed-9a1ecef42b90" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "c57cb62b-d944-4d7e-87ed-9a1ecef42b90" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
